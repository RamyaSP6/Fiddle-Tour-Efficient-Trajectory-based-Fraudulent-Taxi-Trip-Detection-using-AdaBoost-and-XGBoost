# Fiddle-Tour-Efficient-Trajectory-based-Fraudulent-Taxi-Trip-Detection-using-AdaBoost-and-XGBoost
Conventional fraud detection methods prove challenging in real-world scenarios. Hence, we introduce "Fiddle Tour," a system employing a novel fraud detection algorithm and a heuristic trajectory construction algorithm.
